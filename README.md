Overview
Generates embeddable Pump.fun livestream players for any token address (mintId). Provides an iframe embed and a script embed, with dynamic aspect handling and optional styling controls (green border, Pump button linking to pump.fun, mute/unmute control). A server-side proxy requests a LiveKit token from Pump and the client plays the stream.
